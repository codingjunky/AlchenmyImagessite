# 🚀 NEXT AI - START HERE (v3.3 Handoff)

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Version:** v3.3 - No Identity Locks  
**Status:** Code is clean, needs feature work

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL - READ THESE FIRST

**Before touching ANY code, read these 2 files in order:**

1. **NO_IDENTITY_LOCKS_POLICY.md** ⭐ MUST READ FIRST
   - This is the law
   - Overrides all other documentation
   - Never implement identity locks

2. **SESSION_HANDOFF_v3_3.md**
   - What was just fixed
   - Current working state
   - What to avoid

---

## 📋 SESSION HEADER (Use This)

```
Use AMP Studio v3.3. If docs conflict, ask Christopher; default to freedom. 
No identity locks. Analysis can pre-fill editable fields only. Prompts come 
solely from current form values. Never add lock/preserve language or hidden constraints.
```

**Paste this at the start of your session.**

---

## 🐛 ISSUES TO FIX (Priority Order)

### PRIORITY 1: Branding Issues (Fix First)

#### Issue 1.1 - Remove "Claude" Branding
**Problem:**
- Site mentions "Claude" everywhere (not the AI, the product branding)
- This is confusing and incorrect

**What to Fix:**
- Find all instances of "Claude" branding in UI
- Remove or replace with AMP'd Images branding
- Keep "Powered by Claude" in footer (that's okay - refers to AI)
- Check: HTML, marketing copy, headers, tooltips

**Files to Check:**
- `public/studio.html`
- `app/page.tsx` (landing page)
- Any other page components

**How to Find:**
```bash
# Search for Claude mentions
grep -r "Claude" public/
grep -r "Claude" app/
```

---

#### Issue 1.2 - Logo Sizes Wrong
**Problem:**
- Logo images are displaying at wrong sizes
- Looks unprofessional

**Files:**
- `public/Ampd_Image_logo.jpg` (product logo - gold/silver circles)
- `public/AmpStudio_Logo.webp` (company logo - gold lightning bolt)

**What to Fix:**
- Check current CSS for logo sizing
- Adjust to proper display sizes
- Ensure logos look sharp on all screen sizes
- Mobile responsive sizing

**Where They Appear:**
- Header/navigation
- Footer
- Landing page
- Studio page

**Ask Christopher:** What exact sizes should they be? Or should you determine based on design?

---

### PRIORITY 2: Landing Page Enhancement

#### Issue 2.1 - Premium Look & Feel Missing
**Problem:**
- Landing page doesn't feel premium/expensive
- Should match brand: "Visual Alchemy, AMP'd"

**Brand Guidelines (from CLAUDE_BUILD_BRIEF.md):**
- **Colors:** Black background, white/gold text
- **Fonts:** 
  - Display: Clash Display (or Migra)
  - Body: Inter (or Satoshi)
- **Feel:** Bold, premium, power verbs, no jargon
- **Motion:** Subtle animations, gold glow effects

**What to Add/Improve:**
- Premium typography hierarchy
- Smooth fade-in animations
- Gold glow effects on hover
- Professional spacing and layout
- High-quality visual presentation
- Cinematic feel

**Reference Design System:**
```css
:root {
  --ink:    #0B0B0C; /* page bg */
  --gold:   #D6B25E; /* accent */
  --paper:  #F5F3EF; /* text on dark */
}
```

**File to Edit:**
- `app/page.tsx` (landing page)
- `app/globals.css` (styles)

**Ask Christopher:** Show him a preview before finalizing

---

### PRIORITY 3: Missing/Broken Features

#### Issue 3.1 - Video Maker Not Visible
**Problem:**
- Can't see video maker on studio page
- Should be visible somewhere

**Expected:**
- Video prompt generation section
- Separate from image prompt
- Should be accessible on studio page

**What to Check:**
- Is it hidden in the code?
- Is it on a separate tab that's not showing?
- Was it removed in previous cleanup?

**What to Do:**
1. Look for video prompt code in `public/studio.html`
2. Check if there's a tab or toggle for it
3. Make it visible and functional
4. Test that it works

**Ask Christopher:** Where exactly should it appear?

---

#### Issue 3.2 - MidJourney Output Not Showing
**Problem:**
- Only seeing generic "Master Prompt"
- Not seeing MidJourney formatted output
- User wants multiple output options

**Current Behavior:**
- Generates one "Master Prompt"
- Has MJ section but maybe not showing?

**Desired Behavior:**
- Show multiple prompt formats:
  - Master Prompt (general)
  - MidJourney format (with --ar, --s, --q flags)
  - Possibly: DALL-E, Runway, FLUX formats
- Either show all, or ask user which they want

**Enhancement Ideas:**
```
Option A: Show all formats at once
- Master Prompt: [text]
- MidJourney: [text] --ar 16:9 --s 750 --q 2
- Runway: [text]
- DALL-E: [text]

Option B: Let user select formats
☐ Master Prompt
☑ MidJourney
☑ Runway
☐ DALL-E
[Generate Selected Formats]
```

**What to Check:**
1. Look at `public/studio.html` around line 1070-1085
2. See if MJ output section exists but is hidden
3. Check generate() function to see what it outputs

**Ask Christopher:** 
- Which format approach (A or B)?
- Which formats to include?

---

### PRIORITY 4: Video Creation Enhancement

#### Issue 4.1 - Add Video Direction Options/Questions
**Problem:**
- Video creation is too basic
- Just a textarea, not guided

**Current:**
```
[Textarea: "Describe what happens next..."]
[Generate Button]
```

**Desired:**
- Guided questions for video creation
- Prompt: "Do you want to create a video prompt?"
- Options for camera movements
- Scene direction builder
- Foundation for future storyboarding

**Possible Enhancement:**
```
📹 Video Options

❓ Do you want to create a video prompt?
   ○ No, just image prompts
   ● Yes, create video direction

[Expands if Yes selected]

🎬 Scene Direction:
[Textarea: What happens in this scene?]

📷 Camera Movement:
☐ Static
☐ Pan left/right
☐ Tilt up/down
☐ Dolly in/out
☐ Drone shot
☐ Zoom

⏱️ Pace:
○ Slow
● Medium
○ Fast

🎭 Mood:
[Dropdown: Tense, Calm, Energetic, etc.]

[Generate Video Prompt]
```

**Ask Christopher:**
- What specific questions to include?
- How guided should it be?
- Show him mockup before building?

---

#### Issue 4.2 - Consider Separate Video Studio
**Big Question:**
- Should video/storyboard creation be its own dedicated page?

**Current Structure:**
- Landing page (marketing)
- Studio page (image + video prompts)

**Possible New Structure:**
```
Option A: Keep on same page
- Tabs: [Image Builder] [Video Builder]

Option B: Separate page entirely
- Landing → Studio (images) → Video Studio (dedicated)

Option C: Expandable section
- Studio page with collapsible Video section

Option D: Future enhancement
- Leave for later when adding storyboard features
```

**Reasoning for Separate:**
- Video/storyboard is complex enough
- Doesn't clutter image workflow
- Room to grow into full storyboard builder

**Reasoning Against:**
- More navigation complexity
- Might feel fragmented
- Current page can handle both

**CRITICAL:** Ask Christopher which approach before building

---

## 🚫 WHAT NOT TO DO

### Never Do These (From NO_IDENTITY_LOCKS_POLICY.md):

1. ❌ Never lock identity traits
2. ❌ Never make detected fields read-only
3. ❌ Never add `[IDENTITY LOCKED]` or preservation language
4. ❌ Never restrict what users can edit
5. ❌ Never add hidden constraints to prompts
6. ❌ Never implement restrictions without asking Christopher first

### Don't Break These:

- ❌ Don't change the core image analysis flow (it works!)
- ❌ Don't modify the Netlify functions without good reason
- ❌ Don't change brand colors without approval
- ❌ Don't alter the copy from CLAUDE_BUILD_BRIEF.md
- ❌ Don't mess with the logos (just resize them)
