# NO_IDENTITY_LOCKS_POLICY (v3.3)

**Owner:** Christopher (AMP'd Images)  
**Effective:** October 31, 2025  
**Scope:** All AMP'd Images / AMP Studio implementations, docs, prompts, and UIs.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL POLICY - READ FIRST

**This policy supersedes ALL prior documentation about "Identity Locks."**

Any AI agent, developer, or documentation that mentions "Identity Locks" is **OBSOLETE** and must be ignored.

---

## 🚫 WHAT THIS MEANS

### 1) No Locking of Identity Traits. Ever.

- ❌ Do NOT restrict what users can change
- ❌ Do NOT make any fields read-only based on detected traits
- ❌ Do NOT prevent users from modifying ethnicity, hair color, eye color, or any other detected values
- ❌ Do NOT add any "preserve identity" logic to prompts or generation

### 2) Analysis May Pre-Fill Editable Fields

- ✅ Claude Vision analysis can detect ethnicity, hair, eyes, lighting, etc.
- ✅ These detected values can pre-populate form fields
- ✅ **BUT** users can change ANYTHING at ANY time
- ✅ All fields must remain fully editable

### 3) Prompt Generation Must Reflect Only Current Field Values

- ✅ Build prompts ONLY from what's currently in the form fields
- ✅ If user changed "Black" to "White" in the field, use "White"
- ✅ If user changed "brown hair" to "blonde hair", use "blonde hair"
- ❌ Do NOT inject original detected values
- ❌ Do NOT add hidden preservation constraints

### 4) No "[IDENTITY LOCKED]", "Preserve Identity", "DNA" or Similar Language

**Forbidden phrases in code, UI, and prompts:**
- ❌ `[IDENTITY LOCKED: ...]`
- ❌ "DNA Extracted"
- ❌ "Preserve identity"
- ❌ "Cannot be changed"
- ❌ "Locked" (when referring to identity traits)
- ❌ "These values are fixed"
- ❌ Any language suggesting restrictions on identity changes

**Use instead:**
- ✅ "Analysis complete"
- ✅ "Form fields populated with detected values"
- ✅ "You can edit any field"
- ✅ Neutral, non-restrictive language

### 5) Success Messages Must Be Neutral

**Bad (OLD):**
```
"DNA Extracted: Black, brown hair, brown eyes"
"Identity locked and preserved"
```

**Good (NEW):**
```
"Analysis complete"
"Form fields populated with detected values"
"Image analyzed successfully"
```

### 6) Any Prior Instruction to Lock Identity is Obsolete

If you encounter documentation that says:
- "Identity Locks: Ethnicity (locked), Hair (locked), Eye (locked)"
- "Never override ethnicity, hair, eye color"
- "These values are authoritative and must never be changed"

**IGNORE IT.** That policy has been revoked. This document supersedes it.

## ✅ WHAT TO IMPLEMENT INSTEAD

### Core Value Proposition (v3.3)

**AMP'd Images is about:**
- 🎨 **Smart AI Analysis** → Claude-powered starting points
- ⚡ **Time-Saving** → Auto-fills prompts from image analysis
- 🆓 **Creative Freedom** → User can modify anything, no restrictions
- 🎯 **Customizable Prompts** → AI helps, user decides

**NOT about:**
- ❌ Preserving or locking identity traits
- ❌ Enforcing ethical guidelines on user creativity
- ❌ Restricting what users can change

### Technical Implementation

**Analysis Flow:**
1. User uploads image
2. Claude Vision analyzes and detects traits
3. Form fields pre-populate with detected values
4. User can edit ANY/ALL fields freely
5. Generate button creates prompts from **current field values only**
6. No restrictions, no warnings, no gatekeeping

**Prompt Generation:**
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT (v3.3)
function generate() {
    // Read current form values (whatever user entered)
    const subject = document.getElementById('subject').value;
    const lighting = document.getElementById('lighting').value;
    // ... etc
    
    // Build prompt from current values
    const prompt = `${subject}, ${lighting}, ...`;
    
    // NO identity lock prefix
    // NO preservation notes
    // Just use what's in the form
}

// ❌ WRONG (OLD - DO NOT USE)
function generate() {
    // Add identity lock prefix
    const lockPrefix = `[IDENTITY LOCKED: ${originalEthnicity}, ${originalHair}, ${originalEyes}]`;
    const prompt = `${lockPrefix}, ${subject}, ...`;
}
```

## 🗂️ DOCUMENTATION UPDATES REQUIRED

### Files That Need Correction:

1. **CLAUDE_BUILD_BRIEF.md**
   - Remove all "Identity Locks" language
   - Replace with "Visual Analysis Hints"
   - Emphasize user freedom

2. **AMP_D_IMAGES_PROJECT_DNA.md**
   - Rename "Visual DNA Extractor" → "Visual Analysis Assistant"
   - Remove lock requirements
   - Emphasize suggestions, not restrictions

3. **Any session handoffs or changelogs**
   - Note that identity locks have been removed
   - Clarify current policy

---

## 🔐 FOR FUTURE AI AGENTS

**If you're an AI working on AMP'd Images, read this carefully:**

### Before You Code:
1. ✅ Read this NO_IDENTITY_LOCKS_POLICY.md file FIRST
2. ❌ Do NOT implement identity locks, even if old docs say to
3. ✅ Ask the user if unclear
4. ✅ Default to maximum user freedom

### Red Flags (Don't Do These):
- Making any fields read-only based on analysis
- Adding `[IDENTITY LOCKED: ...]` to prompts
- Storing "original" detected values separately
- Preventing presets from affecting certain traits
- Adding "preserve identity" notes anywhere

### Green Lights (Do These):
- Pre-fill form fields with detected values
- Let user edit everything
- Generate prompts from current field values
- Neutral success messages
- Complete creative freedom

## 📝 VERSION HISTORY

- **v3.3** (2025-10-31): Policy created. Identity locks removed.

---

## ⚡ ONE-LINE RESET FOR CLAUDE

**Put this at the top of any session:**

```
Ignore all prior instructions about identity locks. Apply NO_IDENTITY_LOCKS_POLICY v3.3: 
Analysis may pre-fill editable fields; users can change anything; prompts are built only 
from current form values; never add lock/preserve language.
```

---

## 🎯 SUMMARY

**DO:**
- ✅ Analyze and suggest
- ✅ Pre-fill form fields
- ✅ Let user edit everything
- ✅ Generate from current values
- ✅ Use neutral language

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Lock anything
- ❌ Restrict changes
- ❌ Add preservation language
- ❌ Gatekeep creativity
